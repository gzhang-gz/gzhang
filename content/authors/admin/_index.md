I'm a Lecturer at the Department of System Science, Business School, University of Shanghai for Science and Technology (USST, from August 31 2018 to present). 
I received a Master degree in Operational Research and Cybernetics at Shanghai University in 2014. 
And then I pursued my doctoral study at the same university and obtained a Ph.D. degree in Management in July (graduated in May) 2018. 
In 2016 I received a grant from the China Scholarship Council (CSC) to spend eighteen months at Tilburg University as a visiting Ph.D. student in the Netherlands. 
Later on I was accepted as a Ph.D. candidate of CentER in the Department of Econometrics and Operations Research at Tilburg University, and I obtained the second Ph.D degree on August 28, 2018.
